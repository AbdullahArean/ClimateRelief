## Project's Title

### Climate Relief



## Introduction

Natural calamities are a matter of concern for the whole world nowadays. But in our country its effect is much more than any other country of this world. Cyclones and floods are very common in Bangladesh. Every year we face cyclones and floods multiple times specially the people living in the low lying part of the country are the worst sufferers. In these circumstances, they must be ensured of proper relief as they face the scarcity of food, pure drinking water etc. But in our country it is one of the biggest challenges to ensure relief to all who are affected and really badly in need of the relief. Because, there is no such management system to handle it. Moreover, corruption is also a matter of concern. Furthermore, the people who get the relief are not under the consideration of his/her family members. So, to solve those issues, we are making such an app with a complete management system that can ensure “Relief to All” moto. 


## Why Are We Here?
Heavy rainfall throughout the country and the flow of large-scale water often leads to massive flooding situations in low-lying areas of the Northern, northeastern, and south-eastern districts of Bangladesh. Thousands of families get flood affected, lose their houses, and livestock, and struggle with contagious diseases while waiting for support and relief. But most of these people don’t get relief materials even after more than a week of flooding. Our app intends to make sure that victims get proper support/relief and show the donor the claim list so that they will know what and whom to donate.





## Problems we want to solve
Insufficient relief distribution after flood
Victim's names have been deducted from the relief list
No system for complaint
Irregularities in relief distribution
Misappropriation of relief
Mismanagement of giving the relief


## Idea Originality
Despite the sizable problem of relief and its distribution, no one has yet found a solution. We think our app and concept are exceptional and have the potential to advance the issue's resolution.


## Feasibility Of our App
We believe that there is a real need for our app.
Our development platform is Android which holds around 88% of global market share.
We are using Java - secured, high-level & machine independent language to develop our app.
We have used figma to make our app prototype - collaborative, flexible, transparent and community-driven powerful design system.
We want to dedicate this app to the people of our country. We are not planning to get any kind of profit from our app. Our main aim is to give facility to both the donor and claimer.

 
## Requirement Analysis & Objectives

-   Purpose: As our country is pretty much disaster prone, as a result people specially staying in the low-lying part get affected by cyclones and floods very frequently during the monsoon period. In  this case, the poor people needed relief as they lost almost everything during this cyclone and flood. Each of the affected people is not ensured the relief as there is an obstacle of corruption, nepotism and mismanagement.
    
-   Intended users: The intended users are both donor and claimner. A claimer can claim for relief by filling up the registration form along with the claim form.  On the other hand, the donor can see the claimants list from which he/she can select people to donate.
    
-   Intensions: Our intention is very crystal clear, And that is to ensure the relief to all by a proper management system. Moreover, there are some matter to be under consideration in our processing system such as the family members of an affected people, no one would get double relief under a certain amount of time, complaint system etc.
    

## Project Features:

- Interactive & Real-Time Weather Update: <br>
City-specific current weather , Hourly weather forecast with visuals <br>
for the next four days and fifteen-day weather forecast <br>

- Registration & Sign In: <br>
Google Firebase authentication with email validation is utilized for <br>
both registration and sign in. <br>       


- Auto Address Generator for any place of Bangladesh : <br>
A unique database has been established for the entire country of Bangladesh. <br>
- Easy to Use & Smooth UI and UX: <br>
A very engaging UI is created for a better User Experience that is simple and straightforward to use. <br>
- Relief Claim Form with Location: <br>
This section makes use of a database that was created by the author on the various sites in Bangladesh. <br>
- Map Integration & Floating Info show: <br>
This section makes use of the Google Maps API. Furthermore, a popup has been created to display claimer information. <br>
- Proper Validation for Multi-User Platform & Data Entry : <br>
Both claimants and contributors must go through thorough validation and submit the data correctly according to the field. <br>

- Proper Documentation & Github :  <br>
Proper Github Workflow, as well as commits, pulls, and pushes, have been followed on a regular basis. Furthermore, Codes documentation and readme file updates are completed correctly. <br>
- Upload Photo, Change Email and Other info: <br>
Users can upload photos, change their email addresses, report problems, and learn more about the us. <br>

## Limitations:

    

## Our Future  Planning

Bring all the affected people into our scheme <br>
Make a non-android application <br>
Ensure claimer-donor direct communication to avoid misappropriation and mismanagement <br>


## Conclusion 

Apart from learning new languages and technologies, this project taught us collaboration, pressure handling, peer communication, and many other important qualities a software engineer should have. We hope we can implement these learnings in our life in the future to become successful.
