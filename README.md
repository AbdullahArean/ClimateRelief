### Project's Title

Climate Relief



### Introduction

Natural calamities are a matter of concern for the whole world nowadays. But in our country its effect is much more than any other country of this world. Cyclones and floods are very common in Bangladesh. Every year we face cyclones and floods multiple times specially the people living in the low lying part of the country are the worst sufferers. In these circumstances, they must be ensured of proper relief as they face the scarcity of food, pure drinking water etc. But in our country it is one of the biggest challenges to ensure relief to all who are affected and really badly in need of the relief. Because, there is no such management system to handle it. Moreover, corruption is also a matter of concern. Furthermore, the people who get the relief are not under the consideration of his/her family members. So, to solve those issues, we are making such an app with a complete management system that can ensure “Relief to All” moto. 


### Why Are We Here?
Heavy rainfall throughout the country and the flow of large-scale water often leads to massive flooding situations in low-lying areas of the Northern, northeastern, and south-eastern districts of Bangladesh. Thousands of families get flood affected, lose their houses, and livestock, and struggle with contagious diseases while waiting for support and relief. But most of these people don’t get relief materials even after more than a week of flooding. Our app intends to make sure that victims get proper support/relief and show the donor the claim list so that they will know what and whom to donate.





### Problems we want to solve
Insufficient relief distribution after flood
Victim's names have been deducted from the relief list
No system for complaint
Irregularities in relief distribution
Misappropriation of relief
Mismanagement of giving the relief


### Idea Originality
Despite the sizable problem of relief and its distribution, no one has yet found a solution. We think our app and concept are exceptional and have the potential to advance the issue's resolution.


## Feasibility Of our App
We believe that there is a real need for our app.
Our development platform is Android which holds around 88% of global market share.
We are using Java - secured, high-level & machine independent language to develop our app.
We have used figma to make our app prototype - collaborative, flexible, transparent and community-driven powerful design system.
We want to dedicate this app to the people of our country. We are not planning to get any kind of profit from our app. Our main aim is to give facility to both the donor and claimer.

 
## Requirement Analysis & Objectives

-   Purpose: As our country is pretty much disaster prone, as a result people specially staying in the low-lying part get affected by cyclones and floods very frequently during the monsoon period. In  this case, the poor people needed relief as they lost almost everything during this cyclone and flood. Each of the affected people is not ensured the relief as there is an obstacle of corruption, nepotism and mismanagement.
    
-   Intended users: The intended users are both donor and claimner. A claimer can claim for relief by filling up the registration form along with the claim form.  On the other hand, the donor can see the claimants list from which he/she can select people to donate.
    
-   Intensions: Our intention is very crystal clear, And that is to ensure the relief to all by a proper management system. Moreover, there are some matter to be under consideration in our processing system such as the family members of an affected people, no one would get double relief under a certain amount of time, complaint system etc.

## Our Future  Planning

Bring all the affected people into our scheme
Make a non-android application
Ensure claimer-donor direct communication


## Conclusion 

Apart from learning new languages and technologies, this project taught us collaboration, pressure handling, peer communication, and many other important qualities a software engineer should have. We hope we can implement these learnings in our life in the future to become successful.
