### Project's Title

# Climate Relief

### Introduction

Heavy rainfall throughout the country and the flow of large-scale water often leads to massive flooding situations in low-lying areas of the Northern, northeastern, and south-eastern districts of Bangladesh. Thousands of families get flood affected, lose their houses, and livestock, and struggle with contagious diseases while waiting for support and relief. But most of these people don’t get relief materials even after more than a week of flooding. Our app intends to make sure that victims get proper support/relief and show the donor the claim list so that they will know what and whom to donate.
### Why We Are Here?
Heavy rainfall throughout the country and the flow of large-scale water often leads to massive flooding situations in low-lying areas of the Northern, northeastern, and south-eastern districts of Bangladesh. Thousands of families get flood affected, lose their houses, and livestock, and struggle with contagious diseases while waiting for support and relief. But most of these people don’t get relief materials even after more than a week of flooding. Our app intends to make sure that victims get proper support/relief and show the donor the claim list so that they will know what and whom to donate.

### Problems we want to solve
Insufficient relief distribution after flood
Victim's names have been deducted from the relief list
No system for complaint
Irregularities in relief distribution
Misappropriation of relief

### Idea Originality
Despite the sizeable problem of relief and its distribution, no one has yet found a solution. We think our app and concept are exceptional and have the potential to advance the issue's resolution.


## Feasibility Of our App
We believe that there is a real need for our app.
Our development platform is Android which holds around 88% of global market share.
We are using Java - secured, high-level & machine inpendent language to develop our app.
We want to dedicate this app to the people of our country. We are not planning to get any kind of profit from our app. Our main aim is to give facility to both the donor and receiver.
